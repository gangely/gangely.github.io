# my doc

this is `index.md` file and is the `Pages` index

## trying md syntax

my repos:

* hello-world
  * a first repo
* gea
  * [jnz](https://github.com/gangely/gea/tree/master/jnz) - experimenting with the JeeNode Zero; code is Mecrisp Forth
    * tmp36.fs - show temperature from tmp36 sensor
    * oled.fs - jeeLabs file modified to not start `go`
    * temp-oled-multi.fs - print temperature measurement on ssd1306 oled in multitasking

bullet list seems ok

a linked page: [tmp36 doc](tmp36.md)

*This text will be italic*

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_
